\section{Status and Plan}
The $\THESYSTEM$ presented in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic} and Section~\ref{sec:static} are submitted as a paper to POPL'2023 and implemented as well. Below is the timeline plan for the further features of this work.
\begin{itemize}
\item September 05, 2022: Finish the improved execution-based dependency depth analysis and implementation
\item September 20, 2022: Finish Path Sensitive Reachability Bound Algorithm design and starting implementation
\item September 30, 2022: Finish Path Sensitive Reachability Bound Algorithm implementation and formalization.
\item October 15, 2022:  Finish generalization on program resource cost analysis implementation 
and the reduction of CFL-Reachability problem.
\item November 05, 2022: Finish Path Sensitive Reachability Bound paper writing and Submit to PLDI 2023
\item November 20, 2022: Finish thesis
\item December 05, 2022: Defend
\end{itemize}
