\section{Status and Plan}
The program analysis framework presented in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic} and Section~\ref{sec:static} 
based on the language in Section~\ref{sec:language}
 is submitted as a paper to POPL'2023 and implemented as well. 
 Below is the timeline plan for the proposed extensions of this work
 from Section~\ref{sec:furthers}, \ref{sec:generalization} and \ref{sec:cfl_reduction}.
\begin{itemize}
\item September 05, 2022: Finishing the execution-based dependency analysis extension and implementation,
\item September 20, 2022: For the static adaptivity analysis extension, 
finishing the \emph{Path Sensitive Reachability Bound Algorithm} design and implementation, 
\item September 30, 2022: Finishing the \emph{Path Sensitive Reachability Bound Algorithm} implementation and formalization, 
and applying this algorithm into the program analysis framework.
\item October 15, 2022:  Generalizing this program analysis framework onto program's different quantitative properties analysis.
% and the reduction of CFL-Reachability problem.
\item November 05, 2022: Finalizing the \emph{Path Sensitive Reachability Bound Algorithm} and submitting the paper to PLDI 2023
\item November 20, 2022: Finishing the thesis and starting the work on solving the CFL-reachability problem.
\item December 05, 2022: Defend
\end{itemize}
