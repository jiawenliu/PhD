In \redd{PART I}, the new program analysis framework presented in Section~\ref{sec:adapt-analysis}
%  and Section~\ref{sec:static} 
% based on the language in Section~\ref{sec:language}
 is submitted as a paper to POPL'2023 and implemented as well. 
 Below is the plan for
 the works in \redd{PART II} and the final defense.
%  the proposed extensions of this work
%  from Sections~\ref{sec:furthers}, \ref{sec:generalization} and \ref{sec:cfl_reduction}.
\begin{itemize}
% \item September 05, 2022: Finishing the execution-based dependency analysis extension and implementation,
\item September 20, 2022:
% For the static adaptivity analysis extension, 
Finishing the \emph{Path Sensitive Reachability Bound Algorithm} design and implementation and starting thesis writing.
\item September 30, 2022: Finishing the \emph{Path Sensitive Reachability Bound Algorithm} evaluation and formalization, 
and applying this algorithm into the new adaptivity analysis framework.
% \item October 15, 2022:  Generalizing this program analysis framework on analyzing the program's non-monotonic quantitative property.
% and the reduction of CFL-Reachability problem.
\item November 05, 2022: Summarizing the \emph{Path Sensitive Reachability Bound Algorithm} into a conference paper and submitting to PLDI 2023.
\item January 25, 2023: Finishing the thesis and submitting to GRS office, to be approved by the Associate Dean, and submitting the intent to graduate form.
\item February 17, 2023: Final Oral Exam. 
% \item March 10, 2023: Final Oral Exam.
\end{itemize}
