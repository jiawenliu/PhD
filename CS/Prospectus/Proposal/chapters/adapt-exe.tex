According to the second challenge introduced in Section~\ref{sec:adapt-challenge},
i.e., formalizing the intuitive \emph{adaptivity} quantity,
and the limitation in previous \emph{adaptivity} formalization in Section~\ref{sec:prework-formalization},
% I develop a new execution-based program analysis in formalizing this intuitive \emph{adaptivity} quantity

In summary, this new

definition is defined through three steps as follows,
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first step in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic-datadep} defines \emph{dependency relation} used for formalizing adaptivity in step three.
In this step, I define the variable \emph{may-dependency} relation based on the trace semantics from Section~\ref{sec:language-os}.
\item In the second step in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic-reachability}, I compute the \emph{dependency quantity} through 
trace semantics also.

\item The last step in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic-adapt} gives the formal definition for the intuitive \emph{adaptivity} quantity.

According to the two definitions above, specifically \emph{dependency relation} and \emph{dependency quantity},
I define the formal \emph{adaptivity} in definition~\ref{def:trace_adapt} through 
constructing a dependency graph.
