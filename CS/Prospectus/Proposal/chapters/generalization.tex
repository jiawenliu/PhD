\subsection{Introduction and Related Work}
\label{subsubsec:furthers-cost-backgroung}
Through observation in following example, the heap resource consumption during the program 
execution is accumulating in the same way as the program's adaptivity. Specifically, in line 5 
where the list is re-written and the heap consumption is decreased implicitly. 
This implicit decrease 
of the cost works exactly the same as program's adaptivity decrease.
\\
This motivates the generalization of the analysis framework onto the program's resource cost analysis. Use this framework,
I will give
a more accurate resource cost estimation by taking the program's implicit resource cost into consideration, comparing 
to the worst case cost analysis in traditional way.
\\
There are two categories of the program cost analysis, Type-System Based and Static Program Analysis Based. But both of the
works in these two areas fails to recognize the case where program resource consumption is decreased implicitly.
\paragraph*{Type-System Based}
Existing
static program analysis based type-system are mainly through 
effect systems, 
% control-flow analysis, and data-flow analysis~\cite{ryder1988incremental}. 
% The idea of statically estimating a sound upper bound for the adaptivity from the semantics is indirectly inspired from prior work on cost analysis via effect systems~\cite{cciccek2017relational,radivcek2017monadic,qu2019relational}. The idea of defining adaptivity using data flow is inspired by the work of graded 
Hoare logic~\cite{gaboardi2021graded}, and amortized type system~\cite{hoffmann_jost_2022}.
%
In these system, the cost are accumulating through the type induction. The only way to save the cost into the potential
type, as in~\cite{GustafssonEL05} and \cite{hoffmann_jost_2022}, is through explicit abstraction or data structure de-allocation.
That is to say, they cannot deal with the case where the cost (for example the adaptivity) decreases when there isn't a dependency relation between variables.
\paragraph*{Static Program Analysis}
Existing static program analysis works via the control flow or data flow analysis 
in program resource cost analysis 
mainly falls into two areas, the program complexity analysis and worst case execution time analysis. 
They are focusing on analyzing the cost of the entire program. 
The techniques are based on
type system~\cite{CicekBG0H17, RajaniG0021}, Hoare logic~\cite{CarbonneauxHS15}, abstract interpretation~\cite{GustafssonEL05, HumenbergerJK18},
invariant generation through cost equations or ranking functions~\cite{BrockschmidtEFFG16,AlbertAGP08,AliasDFG10,Flores-MontoyaH14}
or a combination of program abstraction and invariant inferring~\cite{GulwaniZ10, SinnZV17,GulwaniJK09}.
In general, these techniques give the approximated upper bound of the program's total running time or resource cost.
However, they failed to consider the case where the cost -- the adaptivity-- could decrease when there isn't a dependency relation between variables.
