\paragraph*{Background and Related Work}There are mainly two categories of methodology in the static program resource cost analysis areas, 
through type-system based and data-flow/control-flow analysis based. 
They can be summarized as follows, but to the best of my knowledge,
all these works in the two categories fail to recognize the case where program resource consumption is decreased implicitly.
 \paragraph*{Type-System Based}
Existing
static program analysis based type-system is mainly through 
effect systems, 
% control-flow analysis, and data-flow analysis~\cite{ryder1988incremental}. 
% The idea of statically estimating a sound upper bound for the adaptivity from the semantics is indirectly inspired by prior work on cost analysis via effect systems~\cite{cciccek2017relational,radivcek2017monadic,qu2019relational}. The idea of defining adaptivity using data flow is inspired by the work of graded 
Hoare logic~\cite{gaboardi2021graded}, and amortized type system~\cite{hoffmann_jost_2022}.
%
In these systems, the cost is accumulating through the type of induction. 
The only way to save the cost into the potential
type, as in~\cite{GustafssonEL05} and \cite{hoffmann_jost_2022}, 
is through explicit abstraction or data structure de-allocation.
That is to say, they cannot deal with the case where the cost (for example the adaptivity) decreases when there isn't a dependency relation between variables.
\paragraph*{Data-flow/Control-flow Analysis Based}
Existing static program analysis works via the control flow or data flow analysis 
in program resource cost analysis 
mainly falls into two areas, the program complexity analysis, and worst case execution time analysis. 
They are focusing on analyzing the cost of the entire program. 
The techniques are based on
type system~\cite{CicekBG0H17, RajaniG0021}, Hoare logic~\cite{CarbonneauxHS15}, abstract interpretation~\cite{GustafssonEL05, HumenbergerJK18},
invariant generation through cost equations or ranking functions~\cite{BrockschmidtEFFG16,AlbertAGP08,AliasDFG10,Flores-MontoyaH14}
or a combination of program abstraction and invariant inferring~\cite{GulwaniZ10, SinnZV17, GulwaniJK09}.
In general, these techniques give the approximated upper bound of the program's total running time or resource cost.
However, they failed to consider the case where the program's cost could decrease when there isn't a dependency relation between variables.

\paragraph{Motivating Example}

\subsection{Proposed Methodology}
\label{subsubsec:furthers-cost-methodology}
As shown in the Example~\ref{ex:heapcost} above, the heap resource consumption during the program 
execution is accumulating in the same way as the program's adaptivity. 
Specifically, in the line: 6 and the line : 9
the list assigned to $x$ and $y$ is re-written instead of accumulated.
So the heap consumption in the loop isn't accumulated recursively, which is 
the same as the case where the adaptivity isn't accumulated because of non-dependency between variables.
In other words, these operations in the above cases imply implicit cost decreases 
which are all considered as increases in the traditional resource analysis 
method.
% In other wor decreased implicitly. 
% This implicit decrease 
% of the cost works exactly the same as the program's adaptivity decrease.
\\
According to this high similarity between the program's resource cost and the 
program's adaptivity property, I plan to adopt the similar analysis procedure as in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic} and 
Section~\ref{sec:static},
and generalize 
% This motivates the generalization of 
% the analysis
$\THESYSTEM$ framework onto the general resource cost analysis. 
Based on this framework,
I will give
a more accurate resource cost estimation by considering the program's implicit resource cost, comparing 
to the worst-case cost analysis in the traditional way. Specifically as follows:
% \\
\paragraph*{Language Generalization} Since the interesting property 
to be analyzed isn't the \emph{adaptivity},
the {\tt Query While} Language will be generalized into standard while language with the inter-procedure function call.
% \\
\paragraph*{Non-Monotonic Resource Cost Formalization through Execution-Based Analysis} 
Formalize the program resource cost through an execution-based program analysis as in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic}.
In this formalization, instead of formalizing the intuitive \emph{adaptive}, the resource cost will be the
target quantitative property of a program.
% \\
\paragraph*{Non-Monotonic Resource Cost Estimation through Generalized $\THESYSTEM$}
According to this high similarity between the program's resource cost and the 
program's adaptivity property, the static program analysis for the resource cost property will 
be performed on a generalized $\THESYSTEM$. $\THESYSTEM$ will be generalized specifically as follows:

% % the analysis
% $\THESYSTEM$ framework onto the program's resource cost analysis. 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The analysis processes in the first two steps of $\THESYSTEM$ in Section~\ref{subsubsec:static-datadep}
 and Section~\ref{subsubsec:static-reachability} will be adopted exactly the same in the generalized $\THESYSTEM$.
 \item Then, generalized $\THESYSTEM$ will construct a similar program-based dependency graph 
 in the same way as in Section~\ref*{subsubsec:static-adapt}, but without query annotation. 
 \item According to the formalized resource cost quantity from the execution-based analysis above,
 generalized $\THESYSTEM$ will add extra annotation on this graph describing this property.
 \item Then, based on the resource cost quantity, the adaptivity quantity in Definition~\ref{def:prog_adapt}
 will be modified for describing this resource cost quantity, through a modified restricted finite walk.
 \item Then in the last step, the adaptivity computation algorithm will be adopted to search for the longest 
 walk under the modified restriction and compute the bound for 
 this resource cost quantity.
\end{enumerate}

% Following the same system structure as $\THESYSTEM$,
% by modifying the restriction on the finite walk, compute different resource costs for the program.
