\subsection{Accurate Dynamic Dependency Depth Analysis}
\label{subsec:furthers-dep-depth}
%
The program's adaptivity in our formal model,
% which we define over the program's execution-based dependency graph from the dynamic 
% analysis 
in Definition~\ref{def:trace_adapt} also
 comes across an over-approximation on the program's
 intuitive adaptivity rounds.
It is resulted from difference between its Dependency Depth analysis and the \emph{variable may-dependency} definition.
It occurs when the weight is computed over the traces different from the traces used in 
witness the \emph{variable may-dependency} relation.

As shown in following example,

1. define the variables dependency relation over two witness traces and an initial trace.
\\
2. Quantify the weight of every edge in the execution-based dependency graph, w.r.t. to the witness traces.

\subsection{Path Sensitive Reachability Bound Analysis}
\label{subsec:furthers-reachability}
In existing static reachability bound analysis, 
it comes across an over-approximation on the estimation due to its path-insensitive nature. 
It occurs when the control flow can be decided in a particular way in front of conditional branches, 
while the static analysis fails to witness. 
As shown in following example, 
\include{examples/multipleRoundsOdd}
