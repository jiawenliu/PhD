Based on the variable \emph{may-dependency} relation in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic-datadep} and 
the dependency quantity analysis in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic-reachability},
% gives us the edges, 
I firstly define the execution-based dependency graph, and then formalize the \emph{adaptivity}.
% \wq{Just a few sentences here, some overview of this subsection. See 4.2 for instance.}
\highlight{
  Benefited from the new language design, dependency relation analysis and the dependency quantity analysis,
this new adaptivity formalization is more precise and efficient than previous work.
It is more scalable to general program, and it provides the program with preciser formal definition for \emph{Adaptivity} than previous definition,

The edges are constructed directly from our variable may-dependency relation. 
For any two vertices $x^{i}$ and $y^{j}$ in $\traceV(c)$, if they satisfy the variable may-dependency relation $\vardep(x^i, y^j, c)$, there is a direct edge between the two vertices in our execution-based dependency graph for program $c$.

The weight is a set of pairs $(x^l, w) \in \traceW(c)$,
with a labeled variable as first component and
its weight $w$ the second component.
Weight $w$ for
% a labeled variable 
$x^l$ is a function $w : \mathcal{T}_0(c) \to \mathbb{N}$
mapping from an initial trace to a natural number.

Given 
a program $c$'s execution-based dependency graph 
% $G_{trace}(c)(\trace) = (\vertxs, \edges, \weights, \qflag)$,
$\traceG({c})$,
I formalize the adaptivity 
with respect to an initial trace $\trace_0 \in \mathcal{T}_0(c)$ by the finite walk in the graph, which has the most query requests along the walk.
We show the definition of a finite walk as follows.

% The query length of a walk $k$ is the number of vertices which correspond to query variables in the vertices sequence of this walk.

%   a \emph{finite walk} $fw$ in $\traceG({c})(\trace)$ is a sequence of edges $(e_1 \ldots e_{n - 1})$ 
%   for which there is a sequence of vertices $(v_1, \ldots, v_{n})$ such that:
%   \begin{itemize}
%       \item $e_i = (v_{i},v_{i + 1})$ for every $1 \leq i < n$.

%       \wq{$\traceW({c})(\trace)$} times.

%   %
%   The length of $fw$ is the number of vertices in its vertex sequence, i.e., $\len(k) = n$.
  Given the execution-based dependency graph $\traceG({c}) = (\traceV({c}), \traceE({c}), \traceW({c}), \traceF({c}))$ of a program $c$,
  a \emph{finite walk} $k$ in $\traceG({c})$ is a 
  function $k: \mathcal{T} \to $ sequence of edges.
  For a initial trace $\trace_0 \in \mathcal{T}_0(c)$, 
  $k(\trace_0)$ is a sequence of edges $(e_1 \ldots e_{n - 1})$ 
  for which there is a sequence of vertices 
  $(v_1, \ldots, v_{n})$ such that:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item $e_i = (v_{i},v_{i + 1}) \in \traceE(c)$ for every $1 \leq i < n$.

  The length of $k(\trace_0)$ is the number of vertices in its vertices sequence, i.e., $\len(k)(\trace_0) = n$.
 \end{defn}

We use $\walks(\traceG(c))$ to denote 
% \mg{``the set'', not ``a set''}a set containing all finite walks $k$ in $G$;
the set containing all finite walks $k$ in $\traceG(c)$;
and $k_{v_1 \to v_2} \in \walks(\traceG(c))$ with $v_1, v_2 \in \traceV(c)$ denotes the walk from vertex $v_1$ to $v_2$ . 
\\
We are interested in queries, so we need to recover the 
variables corresponding to queries from the walk. We define the query length of a walk, 
instead of counting all 
the vertices in $k$'s vertices sequence, we just count the number of vertices which correspond to query variables in this sequence.
%
