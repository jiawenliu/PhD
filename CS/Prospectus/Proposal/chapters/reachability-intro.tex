\highlight{The number of times a given control location 
inside a procedure is visited during the program execution
is an importance reachability quantitative property for programs.
Finding a tight bound on this reachability quantitative property is
useful in different applications, such as
bounding 
resources consumed by a program such as time, memory,
network-traffic, power, 
or helping to estimate other quantitative properties (as opposed to boolean properties)
of data in programs, such as information leakage or uncertainty propagation.

\highlight{In some quantitative property analysis areas, solving this problem is important in helping give a precise analysis result.
For example, in the data analysis area as in PART I, the reachability-bound on each location helps
in giving a precise bound on the adaptive data analysis program's adaptivity quantity through static analysis.
In the security protection area,
how much secret information is leaked by a program depends on the number of times a certain operation that leaks the data,
% either by direct or indirect information flow, 
is executed~\cite{Malacaria07}.
In the privacy protection area, the amount of perturbation in the output data values resulting
from a small perturbation or uncertainty in the input, values depend on the number of times additive error propagation operators are applied.
This is the quantitative version of the boolean problem of continuity studied in~\cite{ChaudhuriGL10}. 
Estimating such quantitative properties again requires addressing a similar question as above:
How many times is a given control location inside the program that performs certain operations executed,
i.e., solving the reachability-bound problem.
In the physical resource cost analysis area, it is important to give a precise estimation
on the program's resource cost bound w.r.t. the program's inputs.
For example, in memory-constrained environments such as embedded systems,
it is important to bound the amount of memory required to run certain applications.
In real-time systems, it is important to bound the worst-case execution time of the program.
Applications running on low-power devices or low-bandwidth environments must use up little power or bandwidth respectively. 
With the advent of cloud computing, where users would be charged per program execution,
predicting resource usage characteristics would be a crucial component of accurate bid placement by cloud providers. 
One of the challenges in bounding this cost precisely is that the resource consumption is location-sensitive.
In other words, different location has different resource cost as well as different execution times.
This brings us to one of the fundamental questions that need to be answered for computing such resource bounds:
How many times is a given control location inside the program that consumes these resources executed,
i.e., solving the reachability-bound problem.
To these reasons, I'm interested in analysis this reachability quantitative property
and provide an accurate solution for the reachability-bound problem.

     However, providing a good solution to this problem is challenging.
 In the paper \cite{GulwaniZ10} that introduces this concept,
 they give a two-steps solution by combining the abstract interpretation-based iterative technique
 and the non-iterative proof-rules-based technique.
 However, their solution doesn't solve the reachability
 bound in a path-sensitive manner.

 There are many works in the program complexity analysis and cost analysis area
 \cite{GustafssonEL05, HumenbergerJK18}, 
 \cite{BrockschmidtEFFG16,AlbertAGP08,AliasDFG10,Flores-MontoyaH14} inferring the tight bound
 on program's overall complexity or resource cost.
But their analysis
focus only on estimating the overall complexity 
by either inferring the loop iteration bounds,
 or computing the worst-case running time.
 None of them solve the reachability-bound problem directly or path-sensitively.
To leverage these limitations,
I plan to design a path-sensitive reachability-bound analysis in this section.
 This analysis aims to solve the 
 reachability-bounds problem path-sensitively.

It has three parts as follows,

 \begin{enumerate}
 \item A standard while language with trace-based operational semantics is presented in Section~\ref{sec:reachability-language}.
 \item The definition for the program's reachability-bound is presented in Section~\ref{sec:reachability-exe}.
 \item A path-sensitive reachability-bounds algorithm is presented in Section~\ref{sec:reachability-static}.
