% Data analyses are usually designed to identify some property of the population from which the data are drawn, 
% generalizing beyond the specific data sample. For this reason, data analyses are often designed in a way that guarantees that they produce a low generalization error.
% That is, they are designed so that the result of a data analysis run on sample 
% data does not differ too much from the result one would achieve by running the analysis over the entire population. 
 
% An adaptive data analysis can be seen as a process composed of multiple queries interrogating some data, where the choice of which query to run next may rely on the results of previous queries. 
% The generalization error of individual query/analysis can be controlled by using an array of well-established statistical techniques.
% However, when queries are arbitrarily composed, the different errors can propagate through the chain of different queries and bring high generalization errors. 
% To address this issue, data analysts are designing several techniques that not only guarantee bounds on the generalization errors of single queries but also guarantee bounds on the generalization error of the composed analyses. 
% The choice of which of these techniques to use, 
% often depends on the chain of queries that an adaptive data analysis can generate.
% Specifically, the total number of queries and the depth of the chain of queries is of great significance 
% to guarantee the generalization error, 
% when the composed data analyses are adaptive. 
% So in order to give a precise guarantee of generalization error
% for the program,
% I am interested in analyzing the depth of the chain of queries in a program, i.e., the program's \emph{adaptivity} property.

 % Unfortunately, this depth which relies on the program(implementation) itself is costly in human efforts, and how to statically obtain this information is not well studied to support data analysts.

In this proposal, I focus on designing

which can provide useful analysis results on both the reachability and quantity aspects.

The first reachability quantitative property
 I focus on is the adaptivity of the program in the adaptive data analysis.
 In this area, a data analysis is designed for identifying  properties for unknown populations 
 through data samples.
 %  ?= is widely 
%  used in research and industrial areas.
It can be modeled as a process composed of 
multiple queries interrogating the data.
%  This is intuitively defined as the depth of the chain of dependent queries. 
 In an adaptive data analysis, the choice of some queries can depend on the results of their previous queries. 
 Hence, these dependent queries form trees in which every query relies on its previous ones.
% the generalization error is propagated through the reliance between the choices of queries.
The \emph{adaptivity} is intuitively defined as the maximum depth of the trees that are formed by these dependent queries
in an adaptive data analysis.
% (i.e., how many queries are relied on others) in the analysis plays a key role in reducing the generalization error.
When generalizing the analysis result from data samples to the unknown populations, 
the generalization error is the key issue on which researchers are focusing to reduce.
% Many researchers have found that the generalization error can be controlled well
% %  by choosing the appropriate statistic technique 
% according to the adaptivity. 
%  Hence, reasoning about 
 Many researchers have found that the
 \emph{adaptivity} is useful for controlling the generalization error of an adaptive data analysis,
 which usually propagates sharply along with the dependent queries. 
 However, when the data analysts implement the adaptive
 data analysis as programs and execute them,
the programs' \emph{adaptivity} are not always clear to them
when they want to use them to control the programs' generalization errors.
In order to assist them automatically and efficiently controling the generalization error using the adaptivity information,
%   when they need it. 
%  To solve this dilemma, I
 I propose a program analysis framework
%   based on dependency graphs,
 to provide an upper bound on \emph{adaptivity}
%   to assist data analysts 
in PART I.
This part is developed by first defining the \emph{adaptivity} for 
 the program that implements an adaptive data analysis
 and then designing
 a program analysis framework for estimating the program's \emph{adaptivity}.
% Next, based on the implementation and experimental results of my \emph{adaptivity} analysis framework, 
% I propose three significant 
% further features can be improved in this framework.
 % and plan to finish the improvement 
 % before the final defense.
% Then according to the connection between the \emph{adaptivity} and the program's resource cost,
% I propose 
% % I propose extensions of this analysis with improved techniques, 
% % and 
% an accurate full-spectrum program resource cost analysis via
% the generalization of my \emph{adaptivity} analysis framework.
% Then according to the similarities between the \emph{adaptivity} and the program's \emph{non-monotonic} resource cost,
% I present 
 % I propose extensions of this analysis with improved techniques, 
 % and 

% In Resource Cost Analysis Area, the Reachability-Bound is an execution property that has broad
% applications in bounding resources cost by a program or analyzing the program's other run-time behaviors.


% Another execution property which is also significant is the non-monotonic quantitative property.
The second quantitative reachability property that I'm interested in is 
% the program's reachability-bound.
% % This property is a worst-case bound on 
the number of times a given control location 
 inside a procedure is visited during the program execution.

Finding a tight bound on this reachability quantitative property is
useful in different applications, such as
bounding 
resources consumed by a program such as time, memory,
network-traffic, power, 
or helping to estimate other quantitative properties (as opposed to boolean properties)
of data in programs, such as information leakage or uncertainty propagation.
This bound is referred as the reachability-bound by \cite{GulwaniZ10} in the first place.

However, computing a tight reachability-bound for a given program control location is challenging.
Many works in the program analysis area develop algorithms estimating the program's loop bound or overall complexity.
% None of them solve the reachability-bound problem directly, or path-sensitively.
