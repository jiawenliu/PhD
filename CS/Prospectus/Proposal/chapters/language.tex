In this chapter, we formally introduce the language we will focus on for writing data analyses.  
This is a simple loop language with some primitives for calling queries. 
After defining the syntax of the language and showing an example, we will define its trace-based operational semantics. 
This is the main technical ingredient we will use to define the program's adaptivity.

\subsection{Syntax of {\tt Query While} Language}
\label{sec:language-syntax}
In this section, we formally introduce the language we will focus on for writing data analyses.  This is a standard while language with some primitives for calling queries. After defining the syntax of the language and showing an example, we will define its trace-based operational semantics. This is the main technical ingredient we will use to define the program's adaptivity.
% We will conclude this section by discussing the limitation of this language with respect to static analysis for adaptivity.
