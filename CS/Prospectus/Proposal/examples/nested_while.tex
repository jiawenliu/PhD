\begin{example}[Resource Cost Example]
  \label{ex:heapcost}
The example program shown in Figure~\ref{fig:heapcost_example.tex} shows the similarity
between the adaptivity and cost estimation.

In order to estimate the worst case heap cost in this program, I analyse the length 
of the list assigned to $x$ and $y$ in line:6 and line : 9 of this program, through $\THESYSTEM$.
Then,  $\THESYSTEM$ computes approximation
of heap resource cost by searching for longest finite walk.
\\
Specifically as follows, 
$\THESYSTEM$ first constructs the program-based execution as in Figure~\ref{fig:heapcost_example.tex},
with weight on each vertex. (The query annotation in the graph is omitted, which isn't useful in analysing the 
list length).
Then $\THESYSTEM$ compute the longest restricted finite walk on this graph.
\\
In order to compute the bound for heap resource cost, the length of walk takes the non-query vertices into consideration as 
well. 

%  largest length of $x$ and $y$ 
% search for a path: $y^6 \to y^6$, and compute the adaptivity for this path as 
% $k$.
% Notice here, another special operation I have in the second branch is Non-updating of
% % Non-updating the 
% $\kw{querynum}$ and $\kw{flowcapacity}$.
% This guarantees both the accuracy and the soundness.
% Specifically,
% % because a second visiting of the same vertex 
% if this vertex is visited, it indicates that a cycle is monitored and  
% % indicates there is a cycle goes back to this vertex, 
% the traversing on this cycle is finished by going back to this vertex.
% %
% % then, when 
% When I continuously search for walks heading out of this vertex, 
% the minimum weight on this cycle does not affect the walks going out of this vertex that not pass this cycle.
% However, if I keep recording the minimum weight, then we
% %  are restricting 
% restrict the visiting times of vertices on a walk by
% using the minimum weight of vertices not on this walk.
% %  , it is unsound anymore.
% Then, it is obviously that this leads to unsoundness.
% If I update the $\kw{flowcapacity}[y^6]$ as $k$ after visiting $y^6$ the second time 
% on this walk,
% % the walk $y^6 \to y^6$,
% and continuously visit $x^9$,
% then the $\kw{flowcapacity[k]}$ is 
% updated as $\min(k, k^2)$.
% So
% %  which 
% % restricting 
% the visiting times of $x^9$ is restricted by $k$ on the walk $y^6 \to y^6 \to x^9$.
% This restriction excludes the finite walk $y^6 \to y^6 \to x^9 \to x^9$ where $y^6$ and $x^9$ visited by $k^2$ times
% in the computation. 
% However, the finite walk $y^6 \to y^6 \to x^9 \to x^9$ where $y^6$ is visited $k$ times and $x^9$ $k^2$ times is 
% a qualified walk, and exactly the longest walk I aim to find. So, by Non-updating the $\kw{flowcapacity}$ after 
% visiting $y$ again, I guarantee that the visiting times og vertices on every searched walk will not be restricted by weights not on this walk,
% i.e., the soundness.
% \\
% In the last line of this dfs algorithm, line: 16, it returns the adaptivity heading out from its input vertex.
% \\
% By applying this deep first search strategy on every vertex on this SCC, 
% I compute the adaptivity of this SCC by taking the maximum 
% % adaptivity reaching every vertex on this SCC.
% value over every vertex.
%
As a result,
the largest heap resource consumed in total, by $y$ and $x$ together computed from the $\THESYSTEM$ is $1 + k^2 + k$.
Comparing to $k + k^2 + k^3$ estimated as  the longest weight path from traditional CFL-reachability method, 
$\THESYSTEM$ analysis result improves the accuracy by $O(n)$.

% Look at a Nested While Loop example program in Figure~\ref{fig:heapcost_example.tex}.
