\begin{example}
Now, I show an example illustrating how our two updating operations for adaptivity 
for each path can guarantee both the accuracy and the soundness. 
Look at a Nested While Loop example program in Figure~\ref{fig:alg_adaptsearch_nestedwhile}.
% Notice here, another special operation I have in the second branch is Non-updating of
% % Non-updating the 
% $\kw{querynum}$ and $\kw{flowcapacity}$.
% This guarantees both the accuracy and the soundness.
% Specifically,
% % because a second visiting of the same vertex 
% if this vertex is visited, it indicates that a cycle is monitored and  
% % indicates there is a cycle goes back to this vertex, 
% the traversing on this cycle is finished by going back to this vertex.
% %
% % then, when 
% When I continuously search for walks heading out of this vertex, 
% the minimum weight on this cycle does not affect the walks going out of this vertex that not pass this cycle.
% However, if I keep recording the minimum weight, then we
% %  are restricting

% Then, it is obviously that this leads to unsoundness.

% To under stand how the two operations 
I first search for a path: $y^6 \to y^6$, and compute the adaptivity for this path as 
$k$.

the traversing on this cycle is finished by going back to this vertex.

Then, it is obviously that this leads to unsoundness.
If I update the $\kw{flowcapacity}[y^6]$ as $k$ after visiting $y^6$ the second time 
on this walk,
% the walk $y^6 \to y^6$,
and continuously visit $x^9$,
then the $\kw{flowcapacity[k]}$ is 
updated as $\min(k, k^2)$.
So
%  which 
% restricting 
the visiting times of $x^9$ is restricted by $k$ on the walk $y^6 \to y^6 \to x^9$.
This restriction excludes the finite walk $y^6 \to y^6 \to x^9 \to x^9$ where $y^6$ and $x^9$ visited by $k^2$ times
in the computation. 
However, the finite walk $y^6 \to y^6 \to x^9 \to x^9$ where $y^6$ is visited $k$ times and $x^9$ $k^2$ times is 
a qualified walk, and exactly the longest walk I aim to find. So, by Non-updating the $\kw{flowcapacity}$ after 
visiting $y$ again, I guarantee that the visiting times og vertices on every searched walk will not be restricted by weights not on this walk,
i.e., the soundness.

In the last line of this dfs algorithm, line: 16, it returns the adaptivity heading out from its input vertex.

By applying this deep first search strategy on every vertex on this SCC, 
I compute the adaptivity of this SCC by taking the maximum 
% adaptivity reaching every vertex on this SCC.
value over every vertex.
%
The largest heap resource consmuption in total, by $y$ and $x$ together computed from the $\THESYSTEM$ is $1 + k^2 + k$.
Comparing to $k + k^2 + k^3$ estimated as  the longest weight path from traditional CFL-reachability method, 
my analysis improved the accuracy by $O(n)$.
