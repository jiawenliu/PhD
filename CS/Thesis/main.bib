                 analysis for a call-by-value lambda-calculus equipped
                 with references, exceptions and let-polymorphism, which
                 we refer to as Core ML. The type system is
                 constraint-based and has decidable type inference. Its
                 non-interference proof is reasonably light-weight,
                 thanks to the use of a number of orthogonal techniques.
                 First, a syntactic segregation between values and
                 expressions allows a lighter formulation of the type
                 system. Second, non-interference is reduced to subject
                 reduction for a non-standard language extension.
                 Lastly, a semi-syntactic approach to type soundness
                 allows dealing with constraint-based polymorphism
                 separately.},
