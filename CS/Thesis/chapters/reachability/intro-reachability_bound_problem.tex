Importance of analyzing the reachability bound.
\\
\textbf{Where it is required? How useful it can be? What impact it can bring?}
\\
\textbf{In one area: area-I}
"One of the fundamental questions that needs to be answered for computing such resource bounds is: 
How many times is a given control location inside the program that consumes these resources executed?"
\\
\textbf{In some other areas, II, III or ...}
How many times is a given control location inside the program that performs certain operations executed?
