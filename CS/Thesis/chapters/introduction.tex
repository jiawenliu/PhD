%%%%% To reason about
\section{Methodology}
We use static analysis techniques to reason about the two main quantitative properties studied in this dissertation: 
the adaptivity of adaptive data analysis programs,
the reachability bound of while loop programs. 

\subsection{Abstract Interpretation}

\subsection{Dependency Graph}
Another quantitative property we study is the adaptivity of adaptive data analysis programs. 
{The adaptivity is defined to be the length of the longest chain of queries of the program in which one query may rely 
on its previous queries in the same chain. 
The adaptivity of a data analysis program is quite different from the relative cost of the two programs. To reason about cost, we can simply sum the costs of sub-programs to get the upper bound of the cost. However, the adaptivity of each sub-program of the target program does not help much in finding the adaptivity. To use a type and effect system to reason about adaptivity, this system should be able to express certain dependencies.
% Of course, we can sum them but then the result becomes imprecise. For this reason, we think the type and effect system is not the good direction to reason about the adaptivity of a data analysis program since it is tricky for the effect to carry information such as one query may depend on the other one. 
We expect adaptivity can also be reasoned about by type and effect systems but in this work, we choose to use a dependency graph to reason about adaptivity.}

{There are two challenges to reason about adaptivity: what will a formal definition of the adaptivity of a data analysis program look like, and how to reason about the adaptivity. 
In our work, the first challenge is solved by a query-based dependency graph generated along with the evaluation of the program. 
Our trace-based operational semantics can generate the trace which tracks the queries asked in the evaluation of the program. 
The query-based dependency graph is constructed based on the queries in the trace. Every node of the graph represents a unique query asked in the program, and the directed edge between two nodes, identifying one query (one node) may depend on the other one. 
The adaptivity is then formally defined as the length of the longest path in the query-based dependency graph.}
{The second challenge is how to estimate the adaptivity of a data analysis program we have just defined. 
In order to upper bound the length of the longest path in the query-based dependency graph, we want to find a path in a dependency graph as well such that the path contains all the queries in that longest path in the query-based dependency graph. 
We develop an algorithm to build a variable-based dependency graph, in which every node represents the unique variable that is assigned in one assignment statement of the program. 
The direct edge between two nodes reflects both the data dependency and control flow dependency between variables. Also, we add the unit weight to the node whose variable is associated with a query result. Then the upper bound on the adaptivity of the data analysis program is estimated by the weight of the path with the highest weights in the variable-based dependency graph.}

{To summarize, we use two dependency graphs for reasoning about the adaptivity of a data analysis program: 
one query-based dependency graph to define the adaptivity, and one weighted variable-based dependency graph to estimate an upper bound on the adaptivity. }

\section{Contributions}

Program analysis techniques are usually applied to study quantitative properties. In comparison to those related works, this dissertation has the following contributions.

\begin{enumerate}

\item We propose a formal definition of the adaptivity of adaptive data analysis programs and develop a graph-based program analysis algorithm that statically estimates the adaptivity.
\item reachability bound computing algorithm
% To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that statically estimates adaptivity to help design adaptive data analysis algorithms.  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dissertation Outline}
This dissertation includes two main parts. 
One reasons about the quantitative property (cost) of programs in the relational setting. Another one aims to use the quantitative property (adaptivity) of adaptive data programs indirectly, as an auxiliary component in data analysis research.

The rest of the dissertation is divided into $5$ parts. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Part \romannum{1}~ 
    
    \item Part \romannum{2}~
    
    \item Part \romannum{3}~{\ADAPTSYSTEM} shows the work on the program analysis algorithms to study the adaptivity of the adaptive data analysis program.    

Chapter~\ref{ch:adapt_intro} gives the introduction of adaptive data analysis in Section~\ref{sec:adapt-backgroung} and the challenges (Section~\ref{sec:adapt-challenges}) we face to obtain the adaptivity to control the generalization error of an adaptive data analysis program.

Chapter~\ref{ch:adapt-definition} presents the details of the loop language (Section~\ref{sec:adapt-loop-syntax}) we use to express data analysis programs, and shows the definition of adaptivity from a trace-based operational semantics in Section~\ref{sec:adapt-os}. 


Chapter~\ref{ch:adapt-algo} describes the program analysis algorithm {\ADAPTSYSTEM} that used to estimate the adaptivity of the data analysis programs (Section~\ref{sec:adapt-ve}, Section~\ref{sec:adapt-matrix}). 
The idea behind the algorithms (Section~\ref{sec:adapt-algo-ideas}) is to construct a data control dependency graph, and add weights to the graph. The adaptivity is estimated by the weight of the path with the highest weight.

Chapter~\ref{ch:adapt-example} presents some more interesting examples {\ADAPTSYSTEM} can analyse. 
It includes a variant of two round data analysis algorithm (Section~\ref{sec:adapt-example-tr-odd}), 
an adaptive multiple rounds data analysis algorithm (Section~\ref{sec:adapt-example-mr}) and an example showing the over-approximate of our approach (Section~\ref{sec:adapt-example-over}). 

Chapter~\ref{ch:adapt-relatedwork} discusses the related works from three perspectives: Static program analysis (Section~\ref{sec:adapt-rw-static}), dynamic program analysis (Section~\ref{sec:adapt-rw-dynamic}) and generalization in adaptive data analysis (Section~\ref{sec:adapt-rw-ge}).  
\item Part \romannum{4} ~ concludes the dissertation and discusses the future directions on studying the two quantitative properties: relative cost and adaptivity.
\item Part \romannum{5} ~gives the appendices. 
 The appendix~\ref{AppC} gives the proof of the lemmas of our framework in adaptive data analysis.
