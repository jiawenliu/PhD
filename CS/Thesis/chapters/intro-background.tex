Skeleton: Current research state on program analysis.
\\
Usefulness of the Program Analysis, through both execution-based and static.
\\
Specifically the usefulness of analyzing complexity.
\\
Motivation for analyzing the accurate complexity for each statement.
\\
Then develop the PART I : Research on reachability-bound Problem.
\\
Then usefulness of the analysis in a specific area: data analysis area.
\\
Motivate the PART II: Using the program analysis techniques analyzing
\emph{ADAPTIVITY} --another quantity property-- for programs.
