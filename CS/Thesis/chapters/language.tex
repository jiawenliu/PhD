In this chapter, 
I formally introduce the language I will focus on for writing data analyses.  
This is a standard while language with some primitives for calling queries. 
After defining the syntax of the language and showing an example, 
I will define its trace-based operational semantics. 
This is the main technical ingredient I will use to define the program's adaptivity.
