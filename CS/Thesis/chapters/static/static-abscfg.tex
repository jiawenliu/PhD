% In an 
%  % a program $c$ 
%  abstract control flow graph for a program $c$, $\absG(c)$,

%  Specifically,
%  The edge is directed, 
%   representing an abstract transition 
%   between two control locations uniquely decided by the labels.   
%    (We refer control location and the label to the same thing). The abstract transition is of the form of a set of difference constraints for variables, built from the abstract execution trace of the program. For instance, the edge $(l_1, dc, l_2)$ from $l_1$ to $l_2$,
%   represents an abstract transition 
%   between two control locations with a set of difference constraints on it.
%  In this transition, the  command labeled with the second location $l_2$, 
%   will be executed after execution of the command with label $l_1$,
%  %  The abstract transition contains a set of difference constraints for variables,

%  Overall, the key point of the abstract excution control flow graph is the construction of the abstract execution trace of a program, which relies on a program abstraction procedure in following steps:

%  \begin{enumerate}
%  \item  Computing the abstract expression for every assignment command in the program.
%  \item Computing the abstract event for every labeled command in the program. Intuitively, this abstract event aims 
%  to approximate the event in program's execution trace.
%  \item Constructing the abstract execution trace for a program.
%  \end{enumerate}  

% We discuss the vertices and edge of the
% abstract control flow graph for a program $c$, $\absG(c)$.

% Every 
% vertex corresponds to the unique
% label.
% Specifically,
% the vertices of this graph is the set of $c$'s labels with an exit label $l_{ex}$, 
% \[ 
%   \absV(c) = labels(c)\cup\{l_{ex}\}
%   \]
% %  corresponding to a label command in the program.

% \paragraph*{Expression Abstraction}

% The expression assigned to the variable on the left hand of the assignment command is abstracted to an abstract value: (adopted from the expression abstraction method in paper \cite{sinn2017complexity}). The abstract value is expressed in the form of Difference constraint, denotated as $DC : \mathcal{VAR} \cup \constdom \to \mathcal{\mathcal{VAR} \times (\mathcal{VAR} \cup \constdom) } \times (\mathbb{Z} \cup \{\infty\})$.  $\constdom$ is called the Symbolic Constant defined as $\constdom \triangleq \mathbb{N} \cup \inpvar \cup \{\max{(\dbdom)}\} $, which consists of 
% natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$,
% the program's input variables $\inpvar$  
% and a constant value $\max(\dbdom)$ for estimating the upper bound of variables which are
% assigned by queries. 

% Give an instance of difference constraint used here,
% $DC(\mathcal{VAR}  \cup \constdom) \cup \{\top\}$ represents all the difference constraints over 
% variable and symbolic constants. 
% % The difference constraint $DC$ over $\mathcal{VAR} \cup \constdom$ 
% It is a set of the inequality of form $x \leq y + v$ where $x \in \mathcal{VAR} $, 
% $y \in \mathcal{VAR}  \cup \constdom$ and $v \in \mathbb{Z}$. 
% This difference constraint is defined in the same way as
% \cite{sinn2017complexity}. For concise, we use $\dcdom^{\top}$ to represent the $DC(\mathcal{VAR}  \cup \constdom) \cup \{\top\}$ .

% \paragraph{Program Event Abstraction}
% We show the abstract event definition, which is generated when computing its abstract execution trace.

% \begin{defn}[Abstract Event]
%   \label{def:abs_event}
%   Abstract Event: 
%   $\absevent \in $
%   $\ldom \times \dcdom^{\top} \times \ldom$
%   is a 
%   % pair of abstract initial state and final state.
%   triple where the first and third components are labels,
%   second component is a constraint from $\dcdom^{\top}$.
%   % the thrid % computed from program's abstract final and initial state, $\absfinal(c)$ and $\absinit(c)$ with formal definition, and algorithm detail in appendix.
%   %  the constraint and the third corresponds to a final state.
%   \end{defn}
%   Specifically, in an abstract event, 
%   the first label correspond to an initial state, and 
%   the second label and the constraint correspond to an abstract final state.
%  The abstract initial state is a label from $\ldom$.
% The abstract final state is a pair from $\ldom \times \dcdom^{\top}$,  
% where first component is a label from $\ldom$ and the second component is a constraint from $\dcdom^{\top}$.
% %

% %
% Given a program $c$, its abstract initial state,
% and the set of its abstract final state is computed as follows,
% %
% \[
%   \begin{array}{ll}
%     \absinit(\clabel{\assign{x}{\expr}}{}^l)  & = l  \\
%     \absinit(\clabel{\assign{x}{\expr}}{}^l)  & = l \\
%     \absinit(\clabel{\eskip}^{l})  & = l \\
%     \absinit(\eif [b]^l \ethen c_1 \eelse c_2)  & = l \\
%     \absinit(\ewhile [b]^l \edo c)  & = l \\
%     \absinit(c_1 ; c_2)  & = \absinit(c_1) \\
%  \end{array}
%  \]
% %
% Final State Abstraction: 
% $\absfinal: \cdom \to \mathcal{P}(\ldom \times \dcdom^{\top})$,
% computes the set of Abstract Final State for the command. 
%  \[
%   \begin{array}{ll}
%     \absfinal(\clabel{\assign{x}{\expr}}{}^l)  & = \{(l, \absexpr\eapp (\expr, x))\}  \\
%      \absfinal(\clabel{\assign{x}{\query(\qexpr)}}{}^l)  & = \{
%       (l, x' \leq 0 + \max(\dbdom) )\}  \\
%      \absfinal(\clabel{\eskip}^{l})  
%      & = \{(l, \top)\} \\
%      \absfinal(\eif [b]^l \ethen c_1 \eelse c_2)  & = \absfinal(c_1) \cup \absfinal(c_2) \\
%      \absfinal(\ewhile [b]^l \edo c)  & = \{(l, \top)\} \\
%      \absfinal(c_1 ; c_2)  & =  \absfinal(c_2) \\
%  \end{array}
%  \]
%  %
%  \paragraph{Abstract Execution Trace}
%  Now, we  extract the abstract execution trace  $\absflow(c)$ for a program, which computes the Abstract Execution Trace for program $c$, as a set of the abstract events $\absevent$.
%  %
%  \begin{defn}[Abstract Execution Trace]
%  \label{def:abs_trace}
%   $\absflow \in \cdom \to \mathcal{P}( \ldom \times DC(\mathcal{VAR}  \cup \constdom) \cup \{\top\}) \times \ldom )$
%   \end{defn}
%  %

 
%   We now show how to compute the abstract execution trace. 
%   For simplicity, we use $\mathcal{P}(\absevent)$ represent the power set of all abstract events, and we have $\absflow(c) \in \mathcal{P}(\absevent)$.
%  We first append a skip command with 
% %  a symbolic label $l_e$, i.e., $\clabel{\eskip}^{l_e}$ at the end of the program $c$, and compute the $\absflow(c) = \absflow'(c')$ for $c'$, where $c' = c;\clabel{\eskip}^{l_e}$ as follows,
% the exist label $l_{ex}$, i.e., $\clabel{\eskip}^{l_{ex}}$ at the end of the program $c$, 
% and compute the $\absflow(c) = \absflow'(c')$ for $c'$, where $c' = c;\clabel{\eskip}^{l_{ex}}$ as follows,
%  %
%  {\footnotesize
%  \[
%   \begin{array}{ll}
%       \absflow'(\clabel{\assign{x}{\expr}}{}^l)  & = \emptyset  \\
%       \absflow'(\clabel{\assign{x}{\query(\qexpr)}}{}^l)  & = \emptyset  \\
%       \absflow'([\eskip]^{l})  & = \emptyset \\
%       \absflow'(\eif [b]^l \ethen c_t \eelse c_f)  & =  \absflow'(c_t) \cup \absflow'(c_f)
%       %   \\ & \quad 
%         \cup \{(l, \top,  \absinit(c_t) ) ,  (l, \top, \absinit(c_f)) \} \\
%       \absflow'(\ewhile [b]^l \edo c_w)  & =  \absflow'(c_w) \cup \{(l, \top, \absinit(c_w)) \} 
%       %  \\ & \quad 
%       \cup \{(l', dc, l)| (l', dc) \in \absfinal(c_w) \} \\
%       \absflow'(c_1 ; c_2)  & = \absflow'(c_1) \cup  \absflow'(c_2) 
%       %  \\ & \quad 
%       \cup \{ (l, dc, \absinit(c_2)) | (l, dc) \in \absfinal(c_1) \} \\
%   \end{array}
%   \]
%   }

%   Notice $\absflow'([x := \expr]^{l})$, $\absflow'([x := \query(\qexpr)]^{l})$ and $\absflow'([\eskip]^{l})$ are all empty set. 
%   For every event $\event$ with label $l$ in an execution trace $\trace$ of program $c$, 
%   there is an abstract event in program's abstract execution trace of form $(l, \_, \_)$.  We also show the soundness of the abstract execution trace, which says \wq{...}
%   \begin{lem}[Soundness of the Abstract Execution Trace]
%      \label{lem:abscfg_sound}
%   Given a program ${c}$, we have:
%   %
%   \[
%      \begin{array}{l}
%       \forall \vtrace_0, \trace \in \mathcal{T} ,  \event = (\_, l, \_) \in \eventset \st

%   \land \event \in \trace 
%   \\
%   \qquad \implies \exists \absevent = (l, \_, \_) \in (\ldom\times \dcdom^{\top} \times \ldom) \st 
%   \absevent \in \absflow(c)
%   \end{array}
%   \]
%   \end{lem}
% %    This lemma is proved formally in appendix~\ref{apdx:reachability_soundness}.
% % For every event $\event$ with label $l$ in an execution trace $\trace$ of program $c$, 
% % there is an abstract event in program's abstract execution trace of form $(l, \_, \_)$. 
% This lemma is proved formally in Lemma~\ref{lem:abscfg_sound} in appendix~\ref{apdx:reachability_soundness}.
% \\
% For every labeled variable in program $c$, $x^l \in \lvar_c$, there is a unique abstract event in program's abstract execution trace $\absevent \in \absflow(c)$ of form $(l, \_, \_)$. 
% \begin{lem}[Uniqueness of the Abstract Execution Trace]
%   \label{lem:abscfg_unique}

% \qquad \implies \exists! \absevent = (l, \_, \_) \in (\ldom\times \dcdom^{\top} \times \ldom) \st 
% \absevent \in \absflow(c)
% \end{array}
% \]
% \end{lem}
% This lemma and proof is also 
% formalized in Lemma~\ref{lem:absevent_unique} in appendix~\ref{apdx:reachability_soundness}.

% Then, we build the edge for $c$'s abstract control flow graph as follos,
% \[
%   \absE(c) = \{(l_1, dc, l_2) | (l_1, dc, l_2) \in \absflow(c)\}
%   \]

% % We have a pre-processing algorithm to go through the programs and returns the list of labels associating with a loop and whose visiting times need to be analyzed.

% \paragraph{Abstract Control Flow Graph}

%
In order to analysis the static data dependency relation and the dependency relation quantity,
I first build an abstract control flow graph as the base step for the analysis in Section~\ref{subsubsec:static-datadep}
and Section~\ref{subsubsec:static-reachability} as follows.
\paragraph*{Abstract Control Flow Graph}
I define an abstract control flow graph for program $c$, 
% which mimics the standard control flow graph, 
whose vertices are the unique labels from $c$'s labeled commands with
% . We also have
a special label $ex$ for the exit of the program. Each edge $(l_1, dc , l_2)$ of our abstract control flow graph is annotated with a difference constraint, which is used to describe the execution of $l_1$. The edge itself talks about the  transition between $l_1$ to $l_2$. Still for the same $\kw{twoRounds(k)}$ example as overview, its generated abstract control flow graph is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:abscfg_tworound}(b).
For example, the edge $(0, a \leq 0, 1)$ on the top, tells us the command 
$\clabel{\assign{a}{0}}^0$ is executed with next continuation location $1$,
where the 
command $\clabel{\assign{j}{k}}^1$ will be executed next.
The constraint $a \leq 0$ is a difference constraint, generated by abstracting from the assignment command $\assign{a}{0}$,
representing that value of $a$ is less than or equals to $0$ after 
location $0$ before executing command at line $1$. The difference constraint is an inequality relation. The left-hand side of the inequality talks about variables before the execution and the right-hand side ascribes those after the execution. 
The difference constraint $a < a+x $ on the edge $(5, a < a + x, 2)$ describes the execution of the command $\clabel{\assign{a}{a + x}}^5$.
% Look at the $a < a+x $ on the edge $5$ to $2$, which describes the execution of the command at line $5$, which is an assignment $a = a+x$. The $a$ on the left side of $a < a+x$ represents the value of $a$ after the assignment, while the right-hand side $a$ stores the value before the assignment. 
The cycle $2 \to 4 \to 5 \to 2$ in Figure~\ref{fig:abscfg_tworound}(b). 
Please also look at the edge from $3$ to $4$, which talks about the query. The $x < Q_m$ describes the execution of a query request (the command at line 3), the query results stored in $x$ is bounded by $Q_m$.
$Q_m$ is the maximal value for query requesting result from the database $DB$. $\top$ means there is no assignment executed, for example, we have the difference constraint $\top$ on the edge $2$ to $6$, means at line $2$, there is no assignment (it is a testing guard $j>0$.)
