\highlight{\paragraph*{Improvements Analysis}
Comparing to previous works,
this new execution-based adaptivity analysis is more elegant and efficient.
It is more scalable to general program, and it provides the program with preciser formal definition for \emph{Adaptivity} than previous definition,
specifically as follows.
% language and operational semantics design improves the expressiveness, efficiency, and the accuracy to a large extend.
\todo{Add details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Improvements on Expressiveness}
    \\
  This language is extended over the standard while language. 
  In this sense, it supports all the general data analysis.
  \item \textbf{Improvements on Efficiency}
  \\
  Also, it extends the standard while language with.
  \item \textbf{Improvements on Accuracy}
  \end{itemize}
