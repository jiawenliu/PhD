% In this section, I present my 
% execution-based adaptivity analysis as the first part of the full-spectrum adaptivity analysis as in Figure~\ref{fig:structure}. 
In this section, 
I formally present a new execution-based program adaptivity analysis based on the language and the trace-based operational semantics introduced above.
As in Figure~\ref{fig:structure}, this is the second major part of this adaptivity analysis framework
built on the language design. 
It is more advanced than previous works
in both the accuracy and efficiency aspects.
This analysis formalizes the intuitive \emph{adaptivity} through three steps.
In Section~\ref{sec:dynamic-datadep}, I first give the new data dependency definition.
Then Section~\ref{sec:dynamic-reachability} presents the dependency quantity analysis for the dependency relation.
The  Section~\ref{sec:dynamic-adapt} gives the formal \emph{adaptivity} definition.

\paragraph*{Execution-Based Adaptivity Analysis Outline}
% To formalize this intuition as a quantitative program property, I develop an

% I first consider all the possible evaluations of a program --- I do this by 
% I use a trace semantics recording the execution history of programs on some given input --- and I create a dependency graph, where the dependency between different variables (query is also assigned to a variable) is explicit and track which variable is associated with a query request. 
% I then enrich this graph with weights describing the maximal number of times each variable is evaluated in a program evaluation starting with an initial state. The adaptivity is then defined as the length of the walk visiting most query-related variables on this graph. 
% Through two aspects: the execution-based analysis and static-based program analysis.
% In the execution-based analysis, I will formalize the intuitive notion of \emph{adaptivity} as a quantitative 
% property of programs. This analysis is developed 
 in three steps as follows,
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item The first step on \emph{dependency relation} analysis is presented in 
 Section~\ref{sec:dynamic-datadep}.
 In this step, I define the variable \emph{may-dependency} relation based on the trace semantics in Section~\ref{sec:language-os}.
%   to analyze the \emph{dependency relation} between every query, 
%  through the methodology of semantic data dependency analysis.
%  %
%  Specifically through a trace semantics recording the execution history of programs on given input,

 \item The last step is the intuitive \emph{adaptivity} quantity analysis presented in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic-adapt}.
 According to the two analysis results above, specifically \emph{dependency relation} and \emph{dependency quantity},
 I define the formal \emph{adaptivity} model in definition~\ref{def:trace_adapt} through
