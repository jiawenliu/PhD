This chapter introduces the previous works on analyzing the adaptivity property
for adaptive data analysis and the limitation analysis.
There are mainly three parts in previous works.
Each of them focus on solving one of the challenges introduced above in analyzing the adaptivity.
In Section~\ref{sec:prework-language}, I introduce the previous language design, which aims to formalize
the adaptive data analysis program and solve the first challenge.
Section~\ref{sec:prework-formalization} summarizes the previous works
on defining this intuitive \emph{adaptivity} quantity through a formal model,
targeting on the second challenge.
Then Section~\ref{sec:prework-static} includes a summary of previous works on estimating
their formalized \emph{adaptivity} and the limitations.
