This chapter introduces the previous works on analyzing the adaptivity property
for adaptive data analysis.
There are mainly three parts of previous works.
Each of them focus on one challenge of analyzing the adaptivity.
In Section~\ref{sec:prework-language}, I introduce the previous works in the language design area aiming to formalize
the adaptive data analysis program.
In Section~\ref{sec:prework-formalization}, I introduce the previous works
on defining this \emph{adaptivity} in a formal model.
Then Section~\ref{sec:prework-static} includes a summary of previous works on estimating
the adaptivity.
