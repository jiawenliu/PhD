In order to analyze this property, there is mainly three property. 
In this proposal, I will first focus on analyzing 
this adaptivity property for the program is based on solving the three problems specifically as follows.

\paragraph{Challenges of Analyzing Adaptivity}
\label{sec:intro-challenge}
There are mainly three challenges in order to analyze this adaptivity property, 
and the full-spectrum analysis of this property is 
% In this proposal, I will first focus on analyzing 
% this adaptivity property for the program based on solving 
developed w.r.t. the three challenges accordingly.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item
 \textbf{Adaptive Data Analysis Formalization}

The first challenge is \emph{how to define formally} a model for adaptive data analysis which is general enough to support the methods I discussed above and would permit to formulate the notion of adaptivity these methods use. 
I take the approach of designing a programming framework for submitting queries to some \emph{mechanism} giving access 
to the data mediated by one of the techniques which are mentioned before, 
including the mechanism of adding Gaussian noise, 
the mechanism that randomly selects a subset of the data, 
and the mechanism that uses the reusable holdout technique, etc. 
In this approach, a program models an \emph{analyst} asking a sequence of queries to the mechanism. 
The mechanism runs the queries on the data applying one of the methods discussed above and returns the result to the program. The program can then use this result to decide which query to run next. 
% Overall, I am interested in controlling the generalization of the results of the queries which are returned by the mechanism, by means of adaptivity. 

% \textbf{Methodology}
Motivated by this, I present a while-like language 
named {\tt Query While} language with extensions on query requests in Chapter~\ref{ch:language}.

\item 
\textbf{Adaptivity Formalization}

The second challenge is \emph{how to define the adaptivity of a given program}.
Intuitively, a query $Q$ may depend on another query $P$, if there are two values that $P$ can return which affect in different ways the execution of $Q$. 
For example, as shown in \cite{dwork2015reusable}, and as I did in our example in Figure~\ref{fig:generalization_errors}(a), one can design a machine learning algorithm for constructing a classifier that first computes each feature's correlations with the label via a sequence of queries, and then constructs the classifier based on the correlation values. 
If one feature's correlation changes, the classifier depending on features is also affected. 
This notion of dependency builds on the execution trace as a \emph{causal history}. 
In particular, I am interested in the history or provenance of a query up until this is executed, 
% I am not then concerned about how the result is used --- except for 
simultaneously in tracking whether the result of the query may further cause some other query. 
This is because I'm focusing on the generalization error which could be propagated by queries.
% and not their post-processing. % 

To formalize this intuitive \emph{adaptivity} as a quantitative program property, 
I develop an execution-based analysis in Chapter~\ref{ch:dynamic}.
% \textbf{Methodology}
% % I first consider all the possible evaluations of a program --- I do this by 
% % I use a trace semantics recording the execution history of programs on some given input --- and I create a dependency graph, where the dependency between different variables (query is also assigned to a variable) is explicit and track which variable is associated with a query request. 
% % I then enrich this graph with weights describing the maximal number of times each variable is evaluated in a program evaluation starting with an initial state. The adaptivity is then defined as the length of the walk visiting most query-related variables on this graph. 
% % Through two aspects: the execution-based analysis and static-based program analysis.
% % In the execution-based analysis, I will formalize the intuitive notion of \emph{adaptivity} as a quantitative 
% % property of programs. This analysis is developed 
%  This execution-based analysis is designed in three steps through different methodologies as follows,
%  \begin{enumerate}
%  \item The first step is to analyze the \emph{dependency relation} between every query, 
%  through the methodology of semantic data dependency analysis.
%  %
%  Specifically through a trace semantics recording the execution history of programs on given input,
%  % --- and I create a dependency graph, 
%  the dependency between different variables (query is also assigned to a variable) is explicitly tracked and 
%  analyzed.
% %   and 
% %   which variable is associated with a query request. 
% % I then enrich this graph with weights describing the maximal number of times each variable is evaluated in a program evaluation starting with an initial state. The adaptivity is then defined as the length of the walk visiting most query-related variables on this graph. 
% % In the execution-based analysis, I will formalize the intuitive notion of \emph{adaptivity} as a quantitative 
% % property of programs. This analysis is developed 
% % \\
%  \item The second step is to analyze the \emph{dependency quantity} 
% %  analysis, 
% based on the \emph{dependency relation} above.
% This analysis is developed through the methodology of execution-based reachability bound analysis.
% % \\
%  \item The last step is the intuitive \emph{adaptivity} quantity analysis, 
%  according to the two analysis results above, specifically \emph{dependency relation} and \emph{dependency quantity}.
%  This step 
% %  is developed through 
% gives the formal \emph{adaptivity} definition as the analysis result. \\
%  Specifically, this analysis is developed through creating a dependency graph firstly. 
%  In this graph, the dependency between different variables (query is also assigned to a variable) 
%  is explicit and track which variable is associated with a query request. 
%  This dependency comes from the \emph{dependency relation} from the first step analysis.
%  \\
% Then, I enrich this graph with 
% weights describing the maximal number of times each variable is evaluated in a program evaluation starting with an initial state. 
% This weight comes from the \emph{dependency quantity} from the second step analysis results.
% \\
%  The adaptivity is then defined as the length of the walk visiting most query-related variables on this graph. 
%  \end{enumerate}
\item 
\textbf{Adaptivity Estimation}

The third challenge is \emph{how to estimate the adaptivity of a given program}. 
The adaptive data analysis model I consider and our definition of adaptivity suggest that for this task 
I can use a program analysis that is based on some form of dependency analysis.
 This analysis needs to take into consideration:
1) the fact that, in general, a query $Q$ is not a monolithic block but rather it may depend, through the use of variables and values, on other parts of the program. 
Hence, it needs to consider some form of data flow analysis. 
2) the fact that, in general, the decision on whether to run a query or not may depend on some other value. Hence, 
 it needs to consider some form of control flow analysis.
3) the fact that. in general, I am not only interested in whether there is a dependency or not, but in the length of the chain of dependencies. 
Hence, it needs to consider some quantitative information about the program dependencies. % {A quick example is that: I store the result of query $Q_1$ in variable $x$ and use variable $y$ to record the result of query $Q_2$. I want to construct the third query $Q_3$ which relies on the value stored in $x$, let us say, $Q_3$ will ask for the sum of the first column of a table if $x$ is positive and the sum of the second column otherwise. In this situation, I need data flow analysis. On the other hand, if I need the value of $y$ to help us decide whether I should ask $Q_3$, for example, I ask the third query if $y$ is odd, and do not ask if $y$ is even. Naturally, to be able to handle this case, control flow analysis comes into play. Formally speaking, }

To address these considerations and be able to estimate a sound upper bound on the adaptivity of a program, 
I develop a static program analysis in Chapter~\ref{ch:static}, named {\THESYSTEM}.

for analyzing the adaptivity, 
the research goal is to develop analysis method which can
% The second challenge is 
\emph{define} the intuitive \emph{adaptivity} rounds for a given data analysis program formally and accurately.
% Intuitively, a query $Q$ may depend on another query $P$, if there are two values that $P$ can return which affect in different ways the execution of $Q$. 
% For example, as shown in \cite{dwork2015reusable}, and as I did in our example in Figure~\ref{fig:generalization_errors}(a), one can design a machine learning algorithm for constructing a classifier that first computes each feature's correlations with the label via a sequence of queries, and then constructs the classifier based on the correlation values. 
% If one feature's correlation changes, the classifier depending on features is also affected. 
The intuition behind this \emph{adaptivity} quantity relies on the dependency between the query requests 
executed in the program, and their dependency depth. 
% This notion of dependency builds on the execution trace as a \emph{causal history}. 
Following this intuition, we need to formally define whether there is dependency between query requests during the program
execution.
%
% And the 
There are different methodologies can be used to formalize the dependency between two query requests, such as the 
dynamic analysis, execution-based analysis, static analysis, etc.
%
In order to capture the dependency (also the intuitive \emph{adaptivity}) in the most precise way,
I design the execution-based program analysis method.
%
% In order to define it in 
% The most precise way to define this dependency is by observing the actual evaluation of these query requests during the

% Based on this, I design the adaptivity formalization method through the execution-based program analysis techniques.
% These execution-based analysis techniques are 
based on observing the actual evaluation of these query requests during the 
program execution. This is consistent with the intuition of query requests dependency and their dependency depth,
as well as the intuitive
\emph{adaptivity}.
% This is because I focus on the generalization error of queries and not their post-processing. % 
\paragraph{Limitations of Existing Execution-Based Program Analysis Techniques}
There are many techniques in the execution-based analysis areas, such are the program simulation, 
semantics analysis, abstract interpretation, etc., which are widely used in dependency analysis. 
However, it is not straightforward that how to apply them into analyzing and formalizing the \emph{adaptivity}
for adaptive data analysis program.
There are following three limitations among existing execution-based analysis techniques.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The state-of-art execution-based dependency relation analysis techniques don't
consider both control influence and value influence. However, both of these
two influences are included by the intuitive query dependency 
in adaptive data analysis programs.
%  require
\item The existing execution-based data dependency analysis area, there isn't any technique taking into account
the dependency depth. However, this dependency depth is the key quantity in formalizing the intuitive \emph{adaptivity}.
\item The intuitive \emph{adaptivity} doesn't accumulate linearly through the dependency relation and 
dependency depth. There is only very limited works related to this non-linear quantity property analysis.
This requires us to design new analysis techniques in order to formalize this quantity precisely.
% here isn't any research combining the two information. No need to mention the adaptivity analysis.

\subsubsection{Static Program Analysis}
\label{sec:intro-static}
% \paragraph{Limitations of Existing Execution-Based Program Analysis Techniques}
%
Though we have the intuitive \emph{Adaptivity} formally and precisely defined through the execution-based program analysis,
it is still not useful enough for programmers.
The weakness of the execution-based analysis comes from its in-efficiency.
It can only give the \emph{Adaptivity} number
after the program is executed multiple times.
When the query requests, the multiple executions consume large amount of computation and communication resources.
This requires us to develop an efficient analysis method, 
which can provide the programmers with the \emph{Adaptivity} quantity.
Because the static program analysis techniques usually don't require the execution of the program,
they are more efficient than the execution-based analysis.
Motivated by this, we develop a static program analysis framework, named {\THESYSTEM}.

\paragraph{Limitations of Existing Program Analysis Techniques}
There are many execution-based program analysis techniques, which are widely used in  dependency analysis. 
However, it is not straightforward when applying to adaptivity analysis.
\begin{enumerate}
\item there isn't static dependency analysis techniques consider both control influence and value influence so far
\item existing static complexity analysis techniques cannot give accurate reachability times on programs 
every execution location path sensitively.
\item there isn't any research or static analysis considering both the dependency analysis
and the complexity. No need to mention the adaptivity analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Methodology}
To address these considerations and be able to estimate a sound upper bound on the adaptivity of a program, 
I develop a static program adaptivity analysis framework, named {\THESYSTEM} in Chapter~\ref{ch:static}.
%  which 
% {\THESYSTEM} combines data flow and control flow analysis with reachability bound analysis~\cite{GulwaniZ10}.
