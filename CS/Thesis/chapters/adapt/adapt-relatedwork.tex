\chapter{Related Work of {\ADAPTSYSTEM}}
\label{ch:adapt-relatedwork}
% \dg{Please cite adaptive Fuzz, and explain how its adaptivity analysis differs from ours.}

In terms of techniques, our work relies on ideas from both static analysis and dynamic analysis. 
We discuss closely related work in both areas.

\section{Static Program Analysis} 
\label{sec:adapt-rw-static}

\section{Dynamic Program Analysis}
\label{sec:adapt-rw-dynamic}


\section{Generalization in Adaptive Data Analysis}
