% I discuss the vertices and edge of the
% abstract control flow graph for a program $c$, $\absG(c)$.
% In the abstract control flow graph,
% every 
% vertex corresponds to the unique
% label.
The abstract control flow graph is a control flow graph, with annotations on every edge. It is constructed as follows.
\paragraph*{Vertices of Abstract Control Flow Graph}
The abstract control flow graph enriches the standard control flow graph vertices set with
one extra label, $l_{lex}$ for each program $c$.
Specifically,
the vertices of this graph is the set of $c$'s labels with an exit label $l_{ex}$, 
\[ 
  \absV(c) = labels(c)\cup\{l_{ex}\}
\]
%  corresponding to a label command in the program.

Overall, the vertices can be easily collected and the key point of construction of the abstract execution control flow graph for a program is the abstract execution trace, 
which relies on the abstraction of expression and abstract transition (we also call it abstract event), I will discuss in the following section.

\paragraph*{Edges of Abstract Control Flow Graph}
  The edge in the abstract control flow graph comes from the abstract execution trace of the program. 
  The abstract execution trace, an abstract representation of the execution, consists of a list of abstract transitions. 
  Then, every abstract transition in the abstraction execution trace corresponds to an edge in the abstract control flow graph.
  In another word, the edge $(l_1, dc, l_2)$ in the abstract control flow graph, represents an abstract transition 
 from $l_1$ to $l_2$, with a set of difference constraints $dc$. 
 Also notice, the difference constraints generated during the abstract transition appears in the edge as annotation.

\paragraph{Edge Construction Step 1: Expression Abstraction}

The expression assigned to the variable on the left hand of the assignment command is abstracted to an abstract value: (adopted from the expression abstraction method in paper \cite{sinn2017complexity}). The abstract value is expressed in the form of Difference constraint, denotated as $DC : \mathcal{VAR} \cup \constdom \to \mathcal{\mathcal{VAR} \times (\mathcal{VAR} \cup \constdom) } \times (\mathbb{Z} \cup \{\infty\})$.  $\constdom$ is called the Symbolic Constant defined as $\constdom \triangleq \mathbb{N} \cup \inpvar \cup \{\max{(\dbdom)}\} $, which consists of 
natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$,
the program's input variables $\inpvar$  
and a constant value $\max(\dbdom)$ for estimating the upper bound of variables which are
assigned by queries. 

Give an instance of difference constraint used here,
$DC(\mathcal{VAR}  \cup \constdom) \cup \{\top\}$ represents all the difference constraints over 
variable and symbolic constants. 
% The difference constraint $DC$ over $\mathcal{VAR} \cup \constdom$ 
It is a set of the inequality of form $x \leq y + v$ where $x \in \mathcal{VAR} $, 
$y \in \mathcal{VAR}  \cup \constdom$ and $v \in \mathbb{Z}$. 
This difference constraint is defined in the same way as
\cite{sinn2017complexity}. For concise, I use $\dcdom^{\top}$ to represent the $DC(\mathcal{VAR}  \cup \constdom) \cup \{\top\}$ .


 I show the expression abstraction $\absexpr : \expr \to \mathcal{VAR} \to DC(\mathcal{VAR}  \cup \constdom) \cup \{\top\} $ below.

This is the same as in paper \cite{sinn2017complexity}. 
\\
For more complex expression assignments, where the counter reset, or calculated from $\elog$, 
multiplication or division, and expressions involving multiple variables, the constraint is approximated as reset of $\infty$.
\\
% This simplification \wq{which part I simplify here?} 
This approximation strategy
doesn't affect our analysis results in our examples. It is easy to extend the normalized expression 
into more complex forms as in \cite{sinn2017complexity}, as well as the 
counter variable manipulation with more advanced expressions.

% The boolean expression in the guard of $\ewhile$ command is normalized into form of $ x > 0$ where $x^l \in \lvar_c$ for some $l$.

\paragraph{Edge Construction Step 2: Abstract Initial and Final State}
%
Abstract initial state: $\absinit(c) \in \ldom$,
Abstract Final State: $\absfinal(c) \in \mathcal{P}(\ldom \times \dcdom^{\top})$

The \emph{Abstract initial state} for a program $c$ is the initial label of this program.
This label corresponds to the first labeled command of this program 
when executing this program.
\\
Given a program $c$, its abstract initial state is computed as follows,
%
\[
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \absinit(\clabel{\assign{x}{\expr}}{}^l)  & = l  \\
    \absinit(\clabel{\assign{x}{\query(\qexpr)}}{}^l)  & = l \\
    \absinit(\clabel{\eskip}^{l})  & = l \\
    \absinit(\eif [b]^l \ethen c_1 \eelse c_2)  & = l \\
    \absinit(\ewhile [b]^l \edo c)  & = l \\
    \absinit(c_1 ; c_2)  & = \absinit(c_1) \\
 \end{array}
 \]
%

The \emph{Abstract Final State} of the program $c$, 
$\absfinal(c) \in \mathcal{P}(\ldom \times \dcdom^{\top})$
is a set of pairs, with a label as first component and a constraint as the second component.
Every pair in $\absfinal(c)$ corresponds to a labeled command of $c$,
and the constraint in this pair is computed by $\absexpr$ in the first step.
\\
Given a program $c$, its final state is computed as follows,
$\absfinal: \cdom \to \mathcal{P}(\ldom \times \dcdom^{\top})$,
% computes the set of Abstract Final State for the command. 
 \[
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \absfinal(\clabel{\assign{x}{\expr}}{}^l)  & = \{(l, \absexpr\eapp (\expr, x))\}  \\
     \absfinal(\clabel{\assign{x}{\query(\qexpr)}}{}^l)  & = \{
      (l, x' \leq 0 + Q_m )\}  \\
     \absfinal(\clabel{\eskip}^{l})  
     & = \{(l, \top)\} \\
     \absfinal(\eif [b]^l \ethen c_1 \eelse c_2)  & = \absfinal(c_1) \cup \absfinal(c_2) \\
     \absfinal(\ewhile [b]^l \edo c)  & = \{(l, \absexpr(\bexpr, \top))\} \\
     \absfinal(c_1 ; c_2)  & =  \absfinal(c_2) \\
 \end{array}
 \]

% \paragraph{Edge Construction Step 3: Program Event Abstraction}
%  I show the abstract event definition, which is generated when computing its abstract execution trace.

% \begin{defn}[Abstract Event]
%   \label{def:abs_event}
%   Abstract Event:

%   \end{defn}
%   Specifically, in an abstract event, 
%   the first label correspond to an initial state, and 
%   the second label and the constraint correspond to an abstract final state.
%  The abstract initial state is a label from $\ldom$.
% The abstract final state is a pair from $\ldom \times \dcdom^{\top}$,  
% where first component is a label from $\ldom$ and the second component is a constraint from $\dcdom^{\top}$.

%  \end{array}
%  \]
%  %
%  \paragraph{Edge Construction Step 3: Abstract Execution Trace Generation}
%  Now, I  extract the abstract execution trace  $\absflow(c)$ for a program, which computes the Abstract Execution Trace for program $c$, as a set of the abstract events $\absevent$.
%  %
%  \begin{defn}[Abstract Execution Trace]

%   $\absflow \in \cdom \to \mathcal{P}( \ldom \times DC(\mathcal{VAR}  \cup \constdom) \cup \{\top\}) \times \ldom )$
%   \end{defn}
%  %

 
%    I now show how to compute the abstract execution trace. 
%   For simplicity, I use $\mathcal{P}(\absevent)$ represent the power set of all abstract events, and I have $\absflow(c) \in \mathcal{P}(\absevent)$.
%   I first append a skip command with 
% %  a symbolic label $l_e$, i.e., $\clabel{\eskip}^{l_e}$ at the end of the program $c$, and compute the $\absflow(c) = \absflow'(c')$ for $c'$, where $c' = c;\clabel{\eskip}^{l_e}$ as follows,
% the exist label $l_{ex}$, i.e., $\clabel{\eskip}^{l_{ex}}$ at the end of the program $c$, 
% and compute the $\absflow(c) = \absflow'(c')$ for $c'$, where $c' = c;\clabel{\eskip}^{l_{ex}}$ as follows,
%  %
\paragraph{Abstract Event and Execution Trace} 
 \emph{Abstract Event}: 
   $\absevent \in $
   $\ldom \times \dcdom^{\top} \times \ldom$,
  \emph{Abstract Execution Trace}: $\absflow \in \cdom \to \mathcal{P}( \ldom \times \dcdom^{\top} \times \ldom )$

 The abstract event is generated during computing its abstract execution trace, its type is defined as follows,
 \begin{defn}[Abstract Event]
   \label{def:abs_event}
   Abstract Event: 
   $\absevent \in $
   $\ldom \times \dcdom^{\top} \times \ldom$
   is a

   Specifically, in an abstract event, 
   the first label correspond to an initial state, and 
   the second label and the constraint correspond to an abstract final state.
  The abstract initial state is a label from $\ldom$.
 The abstract final state is a pair from $\ldom \times \dcdom^{\top}$,

 %
 For simplicity, we use $\mathcal{P}(\absevent)$ represent the power set of all abstract events, and we have $\absflow(c) \in \mathcal{P}(\absevent)$.

  $\absflow \in \cdom \to \mathcal{P}( \ldom \times \dcdom^{\top} \times \ldom )$
  \end{defn}
 %
 The \emph{Abstract Execution Trace} for program $c$ is computed as follows.
 \\
  % We now show how to compute the abstract execution trace. 
 We first append a $\eskip$ command with 
%  a symbolic label $l_e$, i.e., $\clabel{\eskip}^{l_e}$ at the end of the program $c$, and compute the $\absflow(c) = \absflow'(c')$ for $c'$, where $c' = c;\clabel{\eskip}^{l_e}$ as follows,
the label $\lex$, i.e., $\clabel{\eskip}^{l_{ex}}$ at the end of the program $c$, and construct 
the program $c' = c;\clabel{\eskip}^{l_{ex}}$.
Then, we compute the $\absflow(c) = \absflow'(c')$ for $c'$ as follows,
 {\footnotesize
 \[
   \begin{array}{ll}
      \absflow'(\clabel{\assign{x}{\expr}}{}^l)  & = \emptyset  \\

      %   \\ & \quad 
        \cup \{(l, \top,  \absinit(c_t) ) ,  (l, \top, \absinit(c_f)) \} \\

   \end{array}
   \]
   }

   Notice $\absflow'([x := \expr]^{l})$, $\absflow'([x := \query(\qexpr)]^{l})$ and $\absflow'([\eskip]^{l})$ are all empty set. 
   For every event $\event$ with label $l$ in an execution trace $\trace$ of program $c$, 
   there is an abstract event in program's abstract execution trace of form $(l, \_, \_)$.  
    I also show the soundness of the abstract execution trace in Appendix.
  %  which says

This lemma and proof is also 
formalized in Lemma~\ref{lem:absevent_unique} in Appendix~\ref{apdx:reachability_soundness}.

Then, I build the edge for $c$'s abstract control flow graph as follows,
\[
  \absE(c) = \{(l_1, dc, l_2) | (l_1, dc, l_2) \in \absflow(c)\}
  \]

%  I have a pre-processing algorithm to go through the programs and returns the list of labels associating with a loop and whose visiting times need to be analyzed.
