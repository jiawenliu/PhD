The adaptive data analysis designed for identifying  properties for unknown populations / distributions 
through data samples is widely 
used in research and industrial areas.
% , including machine learning areas, etc.. 
When generalizing the result from data sample to the unknown populations, 
the generalization error is a key issue researchers focusing on reducing.
From existing research, the \emph{adaptivity} in the analysis plays a key role in reducing the generalization error.
In this chapter, 
I firstly introduce the  cruciality for reasoning about the \emph{adaptivity} quantity property 
for adaptive data analysis program in Section~\ref{sec:intro-motivation}.
% analyzing 
Motivated by the significance of \emph{adaptivity},
in order to analyze this \emph{adaptivity} property for the adaptive data analysis, there are 3 challenges
% problems encountered.
introduced in Section~\ref{sec:intro-exe}.
% I introduce these three problems
% and the full-spectrum analysis methodologies developed according to these problems 
Targeting to the three challenges, I introduce my full-spectrum analysis methodologies accordingly.
Concretely, the full-spectrum analysis is developed through the language formalization,
the execution-based analysis and the static-based program analysis.
%  Data analyses are usually designed to identify some property of the population from which the data are drawn, 
%  generalizing beyond the specific data sample. For this reason, data analyses are often designed in a way that guarantees that they produce a low generalization error.
%   That is, they are designed so that the result of a data analysis run on sample 
%   data does not differ too much from the result one would achieve by running the analysis over the entire population. 
  
% An adaptive data analysis can be seen as a process composed of multiple queries interrogating some data, where the choice of which query to run next may rely on the results of previous queries.
