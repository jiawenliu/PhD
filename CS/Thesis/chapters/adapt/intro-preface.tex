Targeting to the three challenges, I give a technique overview of this new automatic analysis framework with respect to
the limitations of previous works
in Section~\ref{sec:adapt-intro-overview}.
In summary, this new program analysis framework is developed through three parts:
the language formalization,
the execution-based analysis and the static-based program analysis.
%  Data analyses are usually designed to identify some property of the population from which the data are drawn, 
%  generalizing beyond the specific data sample. For this reason, data analyses are often designed in a way that guarantees that they produce a low generalization error.
%   That is, they are designed so that the result of a data analysis run on sample 
%   data does not differ too much from the result one would achieve by running the analysis over the entire population. 
The last part in Section~\ref{sec:adapt-outline} is an outline of this chapter with the contributions of this work.
% An adaptive data analysis can be seen as a process composed of multiple queries interrogating some data, where the choice of which query to run next may rely on the results of previous queries.
