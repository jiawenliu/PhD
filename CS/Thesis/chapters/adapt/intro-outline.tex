   % \item A trace-based operational semantics for the loop language, specific to dependency between queries.
   \item

   A formal definition of the notion of adaptivity under the analyst-mechanism model.

   A static program analysis algorithm {\THESYSTEM} combining data flow, control flow and  reachability bound analysis in order to provide tight bounds on the adaptivity of a program. 
   %
   \item A soundness proof of the program analysis showing that the adaptivity estimated by {\THESYSTEM} bounds the true adaptivity of the program. 
   \item An implementation of {\THESYSTEM} and an experimental evaluation the bounds this implementation provides on several examples.

\paragraph*{Contributions and Improvements}
Given the limitation of existing reachability bound analysis techniques, I designed a path-sensitive reachability bound 
analysis algorithm

Based on the implementation and experimental results of the basic full-spectrum analysis,
% $\THESYSTEM$,
I 
% also focus on the two further features can be 
extend it in Section~\ref{ch:improved} in following 3 aspects.
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item The precision of formalizing the intuitive \emph{adaptivity} 
% %  in the formal  model 
% through the execution-based program analysis.

% \item In static program analysis, I will give a tighter estimated upper bound on dependency quantity through 
% path sensitive reachability bound analysis techniques. 

% % \item In the third step of static program analysis, I will improve the accuracy of the adaptivity computation algorithm,
% % compute a tighter adaptivity upper bound as well.
% \end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item The {\tt Query While} Language is extended in Section~\ref{sec:refine-exe-language} with inter-procedure call.
   \item In the execution-based \emph{adaptivity} analysis part,
   the precision of formalizing the intuitive \emph{adaptivity} is improved, with extension on the

% in the meantime extend this analysis with 
inter-procedure call in Section~\ref{sec:refine-exe}.
\item The static program \emph{adaptivity} analysis is extended inter-procedure call as well, 
and improved by
giving a tighter estimated upper bound on \emph{adaptivity} in Section~\ref{sec:refine-static}.
%  give a tighter estimated upper bound 
Especially in order to improve the accuracy of the estimated result, a

% designing a
path sensitive reachability bound analysis algorithm is designed in Section~\ref{sec:refine-static-psreachability}.
Based on this newly designed algorithm,
I improve the accuracy of the static \emph{dependency quantity} analysis in the second step 
is improved, and a tighter upper bound on \emph{adaptivity} is computed correspondingly.
% \item In the third step of static program analysis, I will improve the accuracy of the adaptivity computation algorithm,
