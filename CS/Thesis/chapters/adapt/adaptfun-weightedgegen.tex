The edges and weight are estimated through a combined control, data flow, and loop bound analysis.
Because these analyses are all performed on basis of the \emph{Abstract Transition Graph} of the program, we first introduce how to generate this \emph{abstract transition graph} in Section~\ref{sec:alg_abscfg}.
Then Section~\ref{sec:alg_edgegen} presents the edge estimation based on a combined control and data flow analysis algorithm,
and Section~\ref{sec:alg_weightgen}
computes the weight through a loop bound analysis.
