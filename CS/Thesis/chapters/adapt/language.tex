    In this part, 
I formally introduce the new language I will focus on for writing data analyses.  
This is an extended standard while language with some primitives for calling queries.
It improves the expressiveness of previous language design for adaptivity analysis in a large scale.
This part first gives the syntax of the language in Section~\ref{sec:language-syntax} with
analysis on the improvements of this language.
Then in Section~\ref{sec:language-os}, it presents the trace-based operational semantics. 
This is the main technical ingredient I will use to define the program's adaptivity formally.
Section~\ref{sec:language-examples} in the last part presents a manual example demonstrating the language and the operational semantics
rules.
