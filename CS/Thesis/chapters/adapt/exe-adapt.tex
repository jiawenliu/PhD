There are four components of the execution-based dependency graph. 
The vertices $\traceV(c)$ is the set of program $c$'s labeled variables $\lvar(c)$,
which are statically collected.
The query annotation is 
a set of pairs $\traceF(c) \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{LV} \times \{0, 1\} )$ 
mapping each $x^l \in \traceV(c)$ to $0$ or $1$, 
indicating whether this labeled variable is in program $c$'s query variable set $\qvar(c)$.
{
The weights is a set of pairs, $(x^l, w) \in \mathcal{LV} \times (\mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{N})$,
with a labeled variable as first component and
its weight $w$ the second component.
Weight $w$ for
% a labeled variable 
$x^l$ is a function $w : \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{N}$
mapping from a starting trace to a natural number.
When program executes under this starting trace $\trace$,
$\config{{c}, \trace} \to^{*} \config{\eskip, \trace\tracecat\vtrace'} $, it generates an execution trace $\trace'$.
This natural number is the evaluation times of the labeled command corresponding to the vertex, 
computed by the counter operator $w(\trace) = \vcounter(\vtrace', l)$.
We can see in the execution-based dependency graph of $\kw{twoRounds}$ in 
Figure~\ref{fig:twoRounds_example}(b), the weight of vertices in the while loop is  $\env(\trace) k$, which depends on the value of the user input $k$ specified in the starting trace $\tau$.
The directed edges $\traceE({c})$ is also a set of pairs with two labeled variables $ (x^i, y^j) \in \mathcal{LV} \times \mathcal{LV}$, from $x^i$ pointing to $y^j$ in the graph.
The edges are constructed directly from our variable may-dependency relation. 
For any two vertices $x^{i}$ and $y^{j}$ in $\traceV(c)$, if they satisfy the variable may-dependency relation $\vardep(x^i, y^j, c)$, there is a direct edge between the two vertices in our execution-based dependency graph for program $c$.
} 
In most data analysis programs $c$ we are interested, there are usually some user input variables, such as $k$ in $\kw{twoRounds}$. 
We denote $\mathcal{T}_0(c)$ as the set of initial traces in which all the input variables in $c$ are initialized, it is also reflected in $\traceW({c})$.

  \highlight{\paragraph*{Improvements Analysis}
    Previous works do not have any quantity analysis on the dependency relation.
    Comparing to them, this part helps in formalizing adaptivity precisely and efficiently in following senses.
    % It is more scalable to general program, and it provides the program with preciser formal definition for \emph{Adaptivity} than previous definition,
    % specifically as follows.
    % language and operational semantics design improves the expressiveness, efficiency, and the accuracy to a large extend.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Improvements on Accuracy}
      \\
      This quantity analysis can be combined with the
      dependency analysis.
      In this sense, the adaptivity is formalized more precisely with the two information than previous works using
      only the dependency information.
      \item \textbf{Improvements on Efficiency}
      \\
      The reachability times for every variable and every pair of labeled variables does not require
      unfolding the while loop for all possible executions.
      They are designed as functions w.r.t. the input initial traces.
      In this sense, the counting and unfolding is only required when necessary.
      \end{itemize}
      }
\paragraph{Trace-based Adaptivity}
Then, the \emph{adaptivity} is formalized as the 
length of the longest finite walk. 
Differently from the previous one, I restrict 
the occurrence of every edge in a finite walk no more than its weight as well. Formally as follows,
\begin{defn}[Finite Walk (k)].
  \label{def:finitewalk}
  \\
  Given the execution-based dependency graph $\traceG({c}) = (\traceV({c}), \traceE({c}), \traceW({c}), \traceF({c}))$ of a program $c$,
  a \emph{finite walk} $k$ in $\traceG({c})$ is a 
  function $k: \mathcal{T} \to $ sequence of edges.
  For a initial trace $\trace_0 \in \mathcal{T}_0(c)$, 
  $k(\trace_0)$ is a sequence of edges $(e_1 \ldots e_{n - 1})$ 
  for which there is a sequence of vertices 
  $(v_1, \ldots, v_{n})$ such that:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \highlight{
        $e_i = (v_{i}, w_i, v_{i + 1}) \in \traceE(c)$ for every $1 \leq i < n$, 
        and $e_i$ appears in $(e_1 \ldots e_{n - 1})$  at most $w_i(\trace_0)$
        times.
      }
      \item every $(v_i, w_i) \in \traceV(c)$
      % and $(v_i, w_i) \in \traceW(c)$, 
       and $v_i$ appears in $(v_1, \ldots, v_{n})$ at most 
    %   \wq{$\traceW({c})(\trace)$} 
    $w_i(\trace_0)$
      times.  
  \end{itemize}
  %
  The length of $k(\trace_0)$ is the number of vertices in its vertices sequence, i.e., $\len(k)(\trace_0) = n$.
 \end{defn}

We use $\walks(\traceG(c))$ to denote 
% \mg{``the set'', not ``a set''}a set containing all finite walks $k$ in $G$;
the set containing all finite walks $k$ in $\traceG(c)$;
and $k_{v_1 \to v_2} \in \walks(\traceG(c))$ with $v_1, v_2 \in \traceV(c)$ denotes the walk from vertex $v_1$ to $v_2$ . 
\\
We are interested in queries, so we need to recover the 
variables corresponding to queries from the walk. We define the query length of a walk, 
instead of counting all 
the vertices in $k$'s vertices sequence, we just count the number of vertices which correspond to query variables in this sequence.
%
% \mg{I don't understand this definition. Is wrt a single query?if yes, who is chosing the query? Or is it any query?}

\highlight{\paragraph*{Improvements Analysis}
Comparing to previous works,
this new adaptivity definition is more elegant and efficient.
It is more scalable to general program, and it provides the program with preciser formal definition for \emph{Adaptivity} than previous definition,
specifically as follows.
% language and operational semantics design improves the expressiveness, efficiency, and the accuracy to a large extend.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Improvements on Expressiveness}
    \\
    The new adaptivity can provide the adaptivity quantity for
    general data analysis with both user inputs
    and the nondeterministic iterations while loops.
    For these data analysis, previous works cannot provide them with any useful information.
    %
    This improvement is benefited from the new language design in Section~\ref{sec:adapt-language}.
  \item \textbf{Improvements on Efficiency}
  \\
  The efficiency is improved in the following two senses.
  \\
  1. Benefited from the quantity analysis 
      the new adaptivity definition does not require
      unfolding the while loop for all possible executions.
      It is designed as functions w.r.t. the input initial traces as well.
      In this sense, the computing is only required when necessary.
      \\
      2. Benefit from operational semantics, the adaptivity computing based on the execution
      is faster than the previous adaptivity computing. That adaptivity is computed based on the low-efficient operational semantics.
  \item \textbf{Improvements on Accuracy}
  \\
  The accuracy is improved in the following senses,
  \\
  It matches the true intuitive \emph{adaptivity} for the program in the sense that it is defined w.r.t. a program.
  The precision is improved when comparing to the previous adaptivity definition. The previous adaptivity definition,
  relies on a specific
  execution trace and isn't the true intuitive \emph{adaptivity} for the program.
  % which only defines the adaptivity 
  % for a program .
  % , this new formalization matches the true intuitive \emph{adaptivity}.
  \\
  1. Benefited from quantity analysis, the new adaptivity combines the dependency relation and the dependency
  quantity in the dependency graph.
  Then the adaptivity is more accurate than previous one considering only the dependency relation. 
  \\
  2. Benefited from operational semantics, the new adaptivity is defined over all the dependency information.
  In this sense, it is more accurate than previous one based on only the query information.
