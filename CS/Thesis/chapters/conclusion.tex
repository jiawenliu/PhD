In this chapter, we conclude this dissertation, mainly studying two adaptivity of data analysis programs.


 
 \section{Dynamic}
 
 Another quantitative property is the adaptivity of programs. We presented {\ADAPTSYSTEM}, 
 a program analysis algorithm that is useful to provide an upper bound on the adaptivity of data analysis under a specific data analysis model. 
 This estimation can help data analysts to control the generalization errors of their analyses by choosing different algorithmic techniques based on adaptivity. 
 Besides, a key contribution of our works is the formalization of the notion of adaptivity for adaptive data analysis. 

 There are some limitations of this work.
