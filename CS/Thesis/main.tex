%                       PRELIMINARY PAGES
% According to the BU guide the preliminary pages consist of: title, copyright (optional), approval,  acknowledgments (opt.), abstract, preface (opt.), Table of contents, List of tables (if any), List of illustrations (if any). The \tableofcontents, \listoffigures, and \listoftables commands can be used in the appropriate places. For other things like preface, do it manually with something like \newpage\section*{Preface}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This is an additional page (do not hand it in at the library) to print boxed-in title, author and degree statement so that they are visible through the opening in BU covers used for reports. This makes a nicely bound copy.

%%%% TITLE PAGE 
% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space. The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.

%%%% COPYRIGHT PAGE 
% The copyright page is blank except for the notice at the bottom. You must provide your name in capitals.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%% LIST OF JOURNAL ABBREVIATIONS	
% If you don't write the journal names out in full in the bibliography then you need a list of journal abbreviations
% \include{chapters/Journals}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%% 	BIBLIOGRAPHY	
% The bibliography itself can be single spaced with at least one extra space between items

% 1.8.1 Formatting the bibliography
% Include a complete bibliography at the end of the work. Arrange the bibliography alphabetically by the last name of the primary author. You may single-space citations, but leave one line of space between citations. If you use an article style format, where each chapter has its own separate bibliography, you must also include a cumulative bibliography at the end of the work.
% Verify any other requirements for formatting the bibliography at the end of the work. Certain disciplines/departments may require an alternate arrangement to the bibliography, for example, separating primary and secondary sources and then arranging each alphabetically by last name of author.

\newpage
\singlespace
\Urlmuskip=0mu plus 1mu\relax % Don't let the website links get all funky and break the page margins
\bibliographystyle{apa-good} % technically, you need APA. This style file adds the URL to websites and the date accessed. NOTE: Mendeley API does not put the "date accessed" into the .bib file, so you may want to export directly - HG 2018
\bibliography{main.bib} % keep this on, or you will get warnings about undefined citations


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% CURRICULUM VITAE 
% Finally you must include your cv.  You can do that whatever way you like including by formatting it in a totally different program.

% If you would like to grab it from some other source then be sure the page numbering is consecutive with the end of the bibliography and be sure it appears on the table of contents by adding a line such as
